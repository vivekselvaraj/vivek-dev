## Stacktrace 

I‚Äôve been an active listener of the [Stacktrace](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stacktrace/id1359435443?mt=2) podcast by [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) and [Gui Rambo](https://twitter.com/_inside). Being a long time Apple follower, I got hooked immediately, and this is where I first heard about [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish).

## Publish

It was late last year when John talked about his special little project and how he would eventually make it open source. It was a static site generator built with Swift for Swift developers.

He had built his website [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com) using Publish. No JavaScript. Just pure HTML and CSS. The site was blazingly fast. The load time was almost instant. Then I decided. If I ever launch a website, I'll have it JavaScript free. And here we are.

## Catalyst

The time has come, and I have decided to generate my site using Publish. With the limited knowledge of Swift that I had gained through the first 12 days of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), I created a starter website and customised it to my needs.

I've always wanted to try my hand at blogging, but I never thought I was good enough to write. A recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1330559062803673088) by Paul Hudson (the guy behind 100 Days of SwiftUI) was the catalyst that pushed me to do it.
