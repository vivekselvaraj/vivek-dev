## Stacktrace 

I‚Äôve been a long time listener of the [Stacktrace](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stacktrace/id1359435443?mt=2) podcast by [John Sundell](https://twitter.com/johnsundell) and [Gui Rambo](https://twitter.com/_inside). It's a podcast where they talk about Apple and what projects they are working on. Which are predominantly iOS and Swift projects. And I don't know Swift. 

I started listening to Stacktrace when it used to be a podcast where they discuss Apple's leaks, news and rumours from a developer's perspective. I got hooked immediately. Overtime, it evolved into a podcast where they discuss Apple, Swift, their projects and indie development. This is where I first heard about [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish).

## Publish

It was late last year, when John was talking about his precious little project and how he is going to make it open source eventually. It's a static site generator built with Swift for Swift developers. It was also the time where I was jumping from tutorial to tutorial trying to learn Swift and iOS development.

He had built his website [Swift by Sundell](https://www.swiftbysundell.com) using Publish. No JavaScript. Just pure HTML and CSS. That site was blazingly fast. The load time was almost instant. Then I decided. If I ever launch a website, I'll have it JavaScript free.

## Catalyst

The time has come. I have decided to generate my site using Publish. With the limited knowledge of Swift that I had gained through the first 12 days of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), I was able to create a starter website, and customize it to my needs.

I've always wanted to try my hand at blogging, but I never thought I was good enough to write. A recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1330559062803673088) by Paul Hudson (the guy behind 100 Days of SwiftUI) was the catalyst that pushed me to do it.
